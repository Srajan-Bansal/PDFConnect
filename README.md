PDFConnect is a robust and feature-rich web application designed for real-time collaborative writing and PDF editing. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it offers a comprehensive set of tools to allow users to work together seamlessly on text documents and PDFs. Key features include real-time chat, AI-powered question answering, PDF extraction and editing, and system monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Edit and write documents simultaneously with other users using a shared rich-text editor (Quill.js). All changes are synced instantly using Socket.io.
- **PDF Extraction and Editing**: Upload, extract content from PDFs, collaboratively edit it, and download it again as a new PDF.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Ask questions and get answers from AI using Google Gemini to improve writing and research productivity.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Communicate with other collaborators via an integrated real-time chat feature built with Socket.io.
- **Authentication**: Secure user login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, ensuring that only authorized users have access to documents.
- **Email Notifications**: Stay updated with real-time email notifications powered by Redis for events such as document edits or collaboration invites.
- **System Monitoring**: Performance monitoring with Docker, Prometheus, and Grafana to track metrics like server health and response times.
